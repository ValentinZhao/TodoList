# TodoList
***
My first attempt to build a functional web page. A simple To-do list which is quite useful for people who used to list their daily events.
## Usage
Just drag the html file into your Internet browser.
## Feature
- You can add a new event by typing it in input banner and hitting **ADD** button to add it into left box below.
- Every event which stands in left box is an *unfinished event* and you can hit the checkbox to enable it then you are free to click **已完成** button to transfer *finished event* into right box below.
- You can edit what you type by clicking **编辑** button and delete this event by clicking **删除** button.
- In case of deleting events by mistake, I will save all your events that you have added into left box, and you can retrive them by refresh this page- such as hitting **F5** button on your keyboard.
- However, you can click **清除缓存** button then refresh the page if you find that all events this page has saved are useless for you.
## Thanks
I basically understand simple syntax of JavaScript by this tutorial.<br>
If you have any suggestion on UI design or program optimization, please feel free to come up with an **issue**.
